Please use python 3.6+ (Never use python 2). 

For other packages: Although I didn't run all the tests, likely there will be no problem if you use decently recent versions of any packages used in the homework (any version released after 2017).

**If you want, you can increase the number of input parameters, make subfunctions, etc, to realize more general functionalities, unless the "instructions" say not to.** 

This is a set to make you familiarize with Python. I had to design this problem set, because we mostly do not look at the references and/or not trying to use google. You may refer to *Think Python* chapters and if you cannot find the answer, you must use the Internet.

- **Warn**: Be aware not to miss any period (`.`) or quotation marks (`'` or `"`).

1. Write down the results of the following, i.e., write down the results when you `print()` each of these.  [22 point]

   1. `a1 = 3 + 4`
   2. `a2 = 3 + 4.`
   3. `b = 4 - 2`
   4. `c = 9 * 8`
   5. `d = 22 / 3`
   6. `e = 22 // 3`
   7. `f = 22 % 3`
   8. `g1 = 2**2`
   9. `g2 = 2.**2`
   10. `g3 = 2**2.`
   11. `h = "hello"`
   12. `a1t = type(a1)`
   13. `a2t = type(a2)`
   14. `bt = type(b)`
   15. `ct = type(c)`
   16. `dt = type(d)`
   17. `et = type(e)`
   18. `ft = type(f)`
   19. `g1t = type(g1)`
   20. `g2t = type(g2)`
   21. `g3t = type(g3)`
   22. `ht = type(h)`

   

2. Using `assert`, write a one-line code that [4 point]

   1. checks whether `22` is equal to `3*e + f`.
   2. checks whether `g2` is equal to `g3`

3. Write a one-line code which will define `str_quotation`, such that `print(str_quotation)` gives `Hello, World! It's me "Hi"`.  (Hint: use the escape charater `\`, e.g., `\"`.) [4 point]

4. Write down the results of the following, i.e., write down the results when you `print()` each of these. [5 point]

   1. `L_str = ["a", "b", "c"]`
   2. `L_num = [1, 2, 3.]`
   3. `tLs = type(L_str)`
   4. `tLs0 = type(L_str[0])`
   5. `tLn2 = type(L_num[-1])`
