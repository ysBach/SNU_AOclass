# An Example Syllabus
This is an example case of syllabus.

* **TA**s should prepare PCs (i.e., **install python and necessary packages**) before the class. There are multiple explanations about installation in the prerequisites notes, but they are mere "help pages" when students have to setup their own env by themselves in the future (e.g., when they become a PhD student).

1. Preparation
    * Introduce [Software tools](00:Softwares), [python environments](00:Prepare_Python), and [UNIX commands](00:UNIX). Focus on:
        * What tools/packages they will use.
        * For what each of them will be used.
    * Give short lectures on the four notebooks in [python prep](00:python_prep).
    * HW: [](HW:swtools)

2. Week 01:
    * Dealing with FITS (astropy)

If preprocessing-related lecture is required, use [Matthew Craig's CCD Data Reduction Guide](https://www.astropy.org/ccd-reduction-and-photometry-guide/v/dev/notebooks/00-00-Preface.html).
